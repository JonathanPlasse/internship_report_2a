\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
The project of creating a framework has advanced.
A drone design has been created and it is functional.
The setups to fly a with an RC have been tested and documented.
Instructions to install and use ROSÂ on multiple machines have been given.

For the future of this project, there are three different parts to work on.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The simulation of multiple drones with Gazebo and MAVROS.
  \item The communication and control of multiple machines via ROS nodes.
  \item The integration of VICON.
\end{itemize}

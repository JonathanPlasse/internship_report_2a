\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
The project of creating a frameworks has advanced.
A drone design has been created and it is functional.
The setups to fly a with a RC have been tested and documented.
Instructions to install and use ROSÂ on multiple machine have been given.

For the future of this project there is three different parts to work on.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The simulation of multiple drone with Gazebo and MAVROS.
  \item The communication and control of multiple machine via ROS nodes.
  \item The integration of VICON.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Hardware Design and Development of Aerial Robot Swarm Platforms}

\section{Generic Design}

\subsection{Components on the drone}

\subsubsection{Frame}
The choice of the drone frame is really important.
The size of the frame will impact the choice of the propellers, the motors, the \acrshort{esc} and the battery.
It has to be big enough to have enough space for all the components of the drone.
And, as the aim is to create a swarm of drone, the smaller the drone is the better.

\subsubsection{Props}
The propellers have three major characteristics. Their size, their pitch, and their number of blades.

The size of the propellers in part fixed by the size of the frame.

The higher the pitch the higher the thrust but also higher torque is needed from the motors.
Moreover, the pitch should always be less than 2/3 of the propeller size as higher pitch could cause air disturbances (Vortex Ring State).
So, the pitch was chosen by taking the highest pitch on the market that respected the 2/3 ratio.

The number of blades impact thrust and efficiency. More blades mean increased thrust but decreased efficiency.

The propeller specification are generally either \emph{SxPxB} or \emph{SSPPxB}.
S being the size, P the pitch and B the number of blades
(e.g. for a size of 70mm and pitch of 4.5 and 2 blades, 7x4.5x2 and 7045x2).

\subsubsection{Motors}
The motors have different characteristics. Its width, height and KV.

These characteristics are in part fixed by the frame and the propellers.

Some motors comes with propeller adapter.

\subsubsection{ESCs}
The ESC have to major characteristics, their current limit and their max voltage input in S unit,number of cell of LiPo battery (e.g. 3S).

The motor current consumption should never exceed the ESC current limit.

It is advise to buy extra spare esc and oversize them as it is a critical part of the drone.

\subsubsection{Battery}
The battery has a voltage fixed by its number of cells, $3.7V$ nominal per cell.
It has a capacity in mAh,
The current draw the LiPo can support is its capacity times the C-rating.

The motor current consumption should never exceed the maximum current draw of the LiPo.

\subsubsection{Power distribution board}
The PDB has a max current and max voltage that should not be exceeded.

\subsubsection{RC Receiver}
For a drone, the minimum amount of channel for a receiver is 6.
The receiver can either send to the flight controller the received signal via PWM or PPM.

\subsubsection{Flight Controller}
The flight controller is a electronic board with sensors (e.g. accelerometer, gyroscope, barometerâ€¦).

The choice of a flight controller often depends on the compatibility of the firmware wanted. For autonomous drone, the flight controller should be compatible with ArduPilot or PX4 and for racing, It should be compatible with Betaflight.

\subsubsection{Companion computer}
The companion computer on a drone has to be light and not take to much place (it is a major concern).

\subsubsection{WiFi module}
The WiFi module should be selected with the bandwidth required and it should be compatible with the companion computer.

\subsubsection{Cables and Connectors}
Some of the cables and connectors can come with the previous components but often some has to be bought.

It is an important step to verify that everything will be able to be connected to the other components.

\subsubsection{Attaching components}
Straps, screws, mounting tape and zip ties are used to attach the different components of the drone.

\subsubsection{Anti-vibration system}
It is important to reduce the vibration of the sensors on the drone to have accurate data.

\subsubsection{Low-voltage Alarm}
An alarm for low-voltage is important to avoid continuing to fly with an empty LiPo battery that could degrade and even catch fire.

\subsection{Components on the ground}

\subsubsection{RC Transmitter}
As told previously, an transmitter with 6 channels is enough for a drone. But to avoid, buying another transmitter for other projects that need more channel. It is interesting to buy a 8 or 10 channels transmitter.

\subsubsection{Battery Charger}
The battery charger has to be compatible with LiPo with the corresponding voltage.

\subsubsection{LiPo Fireproof Bag}
To recharge LiPo safely using a fireproof bag is a most.

\subsubsection{Propeller Balancer}
The Propeller Balancer is used to balance propeller to avoid vibrations.

It weights 125g.

\subsubsection{Props}
It is 5x3 propeller \cite{bangood_propeller}. The size is 5 inch it is the biggest propeller that would leave enough place for the Jetson Nano. The pitch is 30mm as higher pitch would increase Vortex Risk State. It has 2 blade as it is more efficient and thus less straining for the battery and motor. It is in plastic as it is more resistant to crash.

It weights 2g each so 8g total.

\subsubsection{Motors}
It is Emax RS2205 2300KV \cite{bangood_motor}. The size of 2205 and kv of 2300 is recommended to 5 inch propeller. The thrust with 5x3 propeller at 75\% is 614g with 7.54A consumption. So for a thrust/weight ratio of 2 the drone can weight $1228g=614g \times 4motor / 2$ \cite{google_sheets_motor}.

It weights 30g each so 120g total.

\subsubsection{ESCs}

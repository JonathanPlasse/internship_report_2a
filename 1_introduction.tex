    \section{Project Requirements}
        {\color{red}TODO JONATHAN\\}
        The following high-level requirements are expected to be satisfied in this work: see doc on google drive and put requirements here. \\
        You can ignore the part of compatibility with crazyflie framework, i think it was bad idea in the end.\\
        Also add it would be nice to have all control that is implemented in practice on the drone to be possible to simulate in dynamic simulation as gazebo (I think rosflight has this functionality so good for testing before real flying experiments). If you think about requirement is forgot please add them there. But NOT yet detailed requirements as e.g. a medium frame for the jetson nano

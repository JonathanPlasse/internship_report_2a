Explain the general idea/goal of your internship.

The idea of this internship has been to create a platform to test control algorithm on a swarm of drone using high bandwidth communication, motion capture and ROS.





\section{Project Requirements}
 {\color{red}TODO JONATHAN\\}
The following high-level requirements are expected to be satisfied in this work: see doc on google drive and put requirements here. \\
You can ignore the part of compatibility with crazyflie framework, i think it was bad idea in the end.\\
Also add it would be nice to have all control that is implemented in practice on the drone to be possible to simulate in dynamic simulation as gazebo. If you think about requirement is forgot please add them there. But NOT yet detailed requirements as e.g. a medium frame for the jetson nano
\begin{itemize}
    \item Open source as possible

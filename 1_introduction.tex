The idea of this internship has been to create a platform to test control algorithm on a swarm of drone using high bandwidth communication, motion capture and ROS.





\section{Project Requirements}
The following high-level requirements are expected to be satisfied in this work: see doc on google drive and put requirements here.

Also add it would be nice to have all control that is implemented in practice on the drone to be possible to simulate in dynamic simulation as gazebo. If you think about requirement is forgot please add them there.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Open source as possible
    \item ROS based
    \item Use as much as possible existing solution, to minimize development time.
    \item For quadcopter drone
    \item Use Vicon Motion Capture system indoor
    \item Simulation
    \item
    \item
    \item
\end{itemize}

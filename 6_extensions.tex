\chapter{Extensions around the ArduPilot Framework}

\section{Multi-vehicle}

\subsection{Deployment}
Explain how to deploy code to all Raspberry Pi.
\begin{itemize}
    \item rsync
    \item scp
    \item ssh with commands
    \item bash script (with check for success)
    \item
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ROS Setup}
\subsubsection{Setup on computer}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run on your computer

          \begin{minted}{bash}
    # Install the ros package mavros
    sudo apt install ros-<distribution>-mavros
    # Setup tell ROS what is the IP address of this computer (change 192.168.1.100 by your computer IP address if you use a different one)
    echo "export ROS_IP=192.168.1.100" >> ~/.bashrc
    # Apply modification
    source ~/.bashrc
                    \end{minted}
    \item \texttt{printenv|grep ROS} prints ROS environment variables
    \item \texttt{echo \$ROS\_IP}, to check if the address has been updated
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{ROS Setup on Raspberry Pi}

The Raspberry Pi will use ROS with a \texttt{MAVROS} node on each one. And they will all be connected by wifi to a router that is also connected to computer running \texttt{roscore}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run these commands after ssh into the Raspberry Pi

          \begin{minted}{bash}
# Setup ROS at the startup of the Raspberry Pi
echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
# Install GeographicLib needed for mavros
sudo /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/mavros/install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
# Setup where roscore is running (change 192.168.1.100 by your computer IP address if you use a different one)
echo "export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.100:11311" >> ~/.bashrc
# Setup tell ROS what is the IP address of this Raspberry Pi
echo "export ROS_IP=192.168.1.1<xx>" >> ~/.bashrc
# Apply modification
source ~/.bashrc
                    \end{minted}
    \item \texttt{printenv|grep ROS}: check \texttt{ROS\_MASTER\_URI} and \texttt{ROS\_IP}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{ArduPilot Setup on Raspberry Pi}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run \texttt{sudo nano /etc/default/arducopter}, to use the telemetry the telemetry locally for \texttt{MAVROS}.

          \begin{minted}{bash}
# Change this line
TELEM1="-A udp:192.168.1.100:14550"
# by this line
TELEM1="-A udp:127.0.0.1:14650" #same for all Raspberry Pies
# Save the change
          \end{minted}

    \item Run \texttt{sudo systemctl restart arducopter} to apply change and restart arducopter.
    \item Go into the \texttt{MAVROS} folder with \texttt{roscd mavros}.
    \item Go into the launch folder \texttt{launch} with \texttt{cd launch}.
    \item \texttt{sudo nano node.launch} and \texttt{sudo nano apm.launch}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{minted}{bash}
# In node.launch replace mavros
<node pkg="mavros" type="mavros_node" name="mavros"
# by mavros<xx> (e.g. mavros01) the number of the Raspberry Pi
<node pkg="mavros" type="mavros_node" name="mavros<xx>"
# This will change the name of the mavros node to mavros<xx> to avoid conflict.

# In apm.launch replace
<arg name="fcu_url" default="/dev/ttyACM0:57600" />
<arg name="gcs_url" default="" />
# by this
<arg name="fcu_url" default="udp://:14650@" />
<arg name="gcs_url" default="udp://:14551@192.168.1.100:140<xx>" />
# the fcu_url is the url of the Raspberry Pi local telemetry
# the gcs_url is the url of my computer for the Ground Control Station
\end{minted}

To execute the launch file at the Raspberry Pi start up. A service called \texttt{mavros} has been created.
For more information on service check \ref{services}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{cd /lib/systemd/system}
    \item \texttt{sudo nano mavros.service}
          \begin{minted}{bash}
[Unit]
Description=mavros

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash;\
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.100:11311;\
export ROS_IP=192.168.1.1<xx>;\
/usr/bin/python /opt/ros/kinetic/bin/roslaunch mavros apm.launch"
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
                    \end{minted}
    \item \texttt{sudo systemctl daemon-reload}
    \item \texttt{sudo systemctl start mavros}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Texting on the computer the ROS configuration}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Launch \texttt{roscore} on your computer
    \item Reboot Raspberry Pi \texttt{ssh pi@192.168.1.1<xx> sudo systemctl restart mavros}
    \item Launch QGroundControl
    \item \texttt{rosnode list} should show you

          \begin{minted}{bash}
/mavros<xx>
/rosout
          \end{minted}
    \item \texttt{rosservice call /mavros/set\_stream\_rate 0 10 1}
    \item \texttt{rostopic echo /mavros/imu/data}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{ROS nodes}
ROSÂ is now setup and all Raspberry Pi and the ground station computer.
It is now explained which nodes will be used for the future of this project.
This is a proposition of implementation.

\subsubsection{Node list}

The following nodes are the one that are already implemented.

\begin{description}
    \item[vicon\_bridge] get the absolute position of the drone from the VICON system.
          It run on the ground station computer.
    \item[mavros] is a bridge between the ArduPilot firmware and ROS.
          The drone can be controlled from this node.
\end{description}

The following nodes are the one that will have to be implemented

\begin{description}
    \item[vicon2mavros] transmit the data from \texttt{vicon\_bridge} to \texttt{mavros}.
          Then \texttt{mavros} send the absolute position to the EKF.
    \item[drone2drone] transmit data from the drone and vicon from drone to drone.
          the data transmitted can be customized.
\end{description}

There is one \texttt{mavros}, \texttt{vicon2mavros} and \texttt{drone2drone}
node for each drone. To avoid conflict, \texttt{<xx>} is added to their name (e.g. mavros01, drone2drone42).
All these nodes can run on the ground station control or one can run on each drone.

\section{Simulation}

\subsection{Installation of SITL Software}
Ubuntu 18.04 is used

These \href{http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/setting-up-sitl-on-linux.html}{instructions} have been used to set up the SITL simulator

\begin{minted}{bash}
# Setting up the Build Environment on Linux
    # Clone ArduPilot repository with Copter 3.6 version
cd ~
git clone -b Copter-3.6 https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot
cd ardupilot
git submodule update --init --recursive
    # Install some required packages
Tools/environment_install/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh -y
    # Reload the path (log-out and log-in to make permanent)
. ~/.profile

# Start SITL simulator
cd ~/ardupilot/ArduCopter
sim_vehicle.py --console --map
            \end{minted}

Install the full desktop version of ROS Melodic using this \href{http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu}{link}.

Gazebo is installed with it.

\begin{minted}{bash}
# Try launching gazebo in the terminal
gazebo
            \end{minted}

If there is an error in the terminal containing \texttt{api.ignitionfuel.org}.

Replace inside
\begin{verbatim}
~/.ignition/fuel/config.yaml

url: https://api.ignitionfuel.org
by
url: https://api.ignitionrobotics.org
            \end{verbatim}

Then, the ArduPilot for Gazebo Simulator is installed
\begin{minted}{bash}
# Installation steps
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/khancyr/ardupilot_gazebo
cd ardupilot_gazebo
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
sudo make install

# Launch Gazebo with
gazebo --verbose worlds/iris_arducopter_runway.world

# and in another terminal execute

../Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py -f gazebo-iris --console --map
            \end{minted}

Installation of MAVROS \href{http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/ros-install.html#installing-mavros}{link}
\begin{minted}{bash}
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-mavros ros-melodic-mavros-extras

# The following command is cut in two lines as it did not fit on the page.
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mavlink/mavros/master/mavros\
/scripts/install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
chmod a+x install_geographiclib_datasets.sh

# If this command return This script require root privileges!
./install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
# Run with sudo
sudo ./install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
# Then delete the script
rm install_geographiclib_datasets.sh

# The following command is cut in two lines as it did not fit on the page.
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rqt ros-melodic-rqt-common-plugins\ ros-melodic-rqt-robot-plugins python-catkin-tools
            \end{minted}

Connect ArduPilot to ROS \href{http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/ros-sitl.html}{link}
\begin{minted}{bash}
# Create ArduPilot ROS workspace
cd ~
mkdir -p ardupilot_ws/src
cd ardupilot_ws
catkin init
cd src

# Copy apm.launch from MAVROS
cd ~/ardupilot_ws
mkdir launch
cd launch
roscp mavros apm.launch apm.launch
            \end{minted}

Replace inside \texttt{apm.launch}
\begin{verbatim}
<arg name="fcu_url" default="/dev/ttyACM0:57600" />
by
<arg name="fcu_url" default="udp://127.0.0.1:14551@14555" />
            \end{verbatim}

\begin{minted}{bash}
# Then launch
roslaunch apm.launch

# You can use rqt to interact with ArduPilot
rqt
            \end{minted}

\subsection{SITL + Gazebo + ROS}

Resources to use SITL+Gazebo+ROS \cite{youtube_gazebo_ros} \cite{github_gazebo_ros}.



\section{Vicon and Kalman filter}
There are two way to interface with Vicon. Either via Vicon DataStream SDK or VRPN.

\subsection{API}
\subsubsection{Vicon DataStream SDK}
It is an Development Kit from Vicon. It give an easy access to the Vicon DataStream. It is compatible with Vicon Tracker and Nexus. \href{https://www.vicon.com/downloads/utilities-and-sdk/datastream-sdk}{Link}. A ROS package has already been implemented to use it, \href{https://github.com/ethz-asl/vicon_bridge}{vicon\_bridge}.
The last commit is from 4 years ago but it should still work according to \href{https://answers.ros.org/question/329849/which-ros-package-use-with-vicon/}{this}.

\subsubsection{VRPN}
It is a network based interface to access data of motion capture software. It is compatible only with Vicon Tracker and not with Vicon Nexus. It works out of the box with \href{https://wiki.ros.org/vrpn_client_ros}{vrpn\_client\_ros}. When an object is created in Vicon Tracker, the object information is stream automaticaly via vrpn.

\subsection{Implementation}
\href{http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-optitrack.html#common-optitrack}{This} is a project with Optitrack. There is a resources about how to pass the position and attitude of the drone given by the VICON system to the EKF of the drone, how to set up the EKF.

\section{Drone control}
PX4 \href{https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/offboard-control/37869}{page} for Offboard control.

ArduPilot \href{http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/ac2_guidedmode.html#guided-nogps}{page} for guided mode with no\_gps

The mavlink message \texttt{SET\_ATTITUDE\_TARGET} allow to control the attitude of the drone at the same altitude.
